Title:
Tetris 

General Description :
Tetris game:
This game builds from 7 different shapes: I , J , L , O , S , T, Z.
Any Shapes composed of four square blocks each and their color is random. 
Any iteration the user gets random shape, and should move each one sideways. The user can rotate the shape by 90 degree units. The aim of creating a horizontal line of 10 units without gaps. When such a line is created , it gets destroyed and any block above the deleted line will fall.
 When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the shape to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of shape reaches the top of the playing field and no new shape are able to enter. 

Design:

interaction:
the program has 3 main classes – Shapes, Board and controller.


the first one is the Board class which
holds a vector of vector and create the board of the game.

The second class is Shapes - this is the base class which all of the derived shapes classes derive from 
(the derived classes are: I , J , L , O , S , T, Z).
The class defines the size of all the shapes, while each shape by itself has different position, and rotate according it.

The third class is Controller – actually the game manager.
It controlled the Score, level, speed etc.

In addition there is special class “Screens”, Who managed the screens of the game.




Special functions:
1. Board – “updateRows” – updates the rows after breaking.
2. Controller – “insertShape”- insert shape to the queue.
3. Controller – “DrawNextShape” – drawing the next shape beside the main board.
4. Controller – “SwitchShape” – insert the next shape to the board and entered another        
   shape to the queue.
5. Shape – “rotateShape” – rotating the shape 90 degrees.


Class Screens:
Controlled the screens along the game. 

class Controller:
the controller game. Manages the level , score , and the music around it.


class Shapes:
created the general shapes who composed of 4 square blocks.

class I , J , L , O , S , T, Z:
the shapes.

Special Additions:

1.	Music: (folder: “sound”)
a.	Menu
b.	Play
c.	Lines cleared.
d.	Level finished
e.	Game over

2.	Screens : (folder : “screens”)
a.	Menu
b.	“get ready!”
c.	Play
d.	“next level!”
e.	Game over

3.	Using STL


Main data structures:
1.	STL
2.	Vector of Rectangle Shape.(Board & Shape class).
3.	Vector of Vector of unique pointer (Board class).
4.	Queue (Controller Class).

Special usings:
SFML lib.
